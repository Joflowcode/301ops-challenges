# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b

# Create an if statement using a logical conditional of your choice and include elif keyword that executes when other conditions are not met.

# Create an if statement that includes both elif and else to execute when both if and elif are not met.
